## Overview

We introduce **SteeringSafety**: a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating representation steering methods across seven safety perspectives. 

Our focus is on 1) how effective current steering methods are on standardized safety perspectives, and 2) understanding how steering one perspective affects others, which is critical for safe deployment.

We hope this benchmark will foster development of more precise steering methods and serve as a platform for introducing new approaches to increase safety and datasets to test them.

### Key Contributions

- üìä **17 datasets** collected and standardized covering **7 perspectives** for measuring safety behaviors
- üîß **Modular framework** decomposing training-free steering methods into standardized, interchangeable components

## üöÄ Quick Start
Before running, ensure you have Python 3.10+ with an up-to-date version of pip (`pip install --upgrade pip` if necessary). A CUDA-capable GPU is recommended for larger models.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/wang-research-lab/SteeringSafety.git
cd SteeringSafety

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Configure .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set API keys (see below for requirements)

# Quick test with no API keys needed (primary behavior only, debug mode, small model)
python scripts/run/run_full_pipeline.py -m qwen25-05b -c explicit_bias -M dim --primary-only --debug

```

### API Key Requirements

Different experiments require different API keys:

**For Steered Perspectives Only** (no API keys needed):
- Explicit/Implicit Bias (ToxiGen, BBQ) - uses exact match evaluation
- Intrinsic Hallucination (FaithEval) - uses exact match evaluation

**Requires Groq API Key** (`GROQ_API_KEY`):
- Extrinsic Hallucination (PreciseWikiQA) - uses `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for evaluation
- Refusal (SALADBench) - if using `REFUSAL_EVAL_METHOD=GROQ` (default)

**Requires OpenAI API Key** (`OPENAI_API_KEY`):
- 5 DarkBench datasets: Brand Bias, Sycophancy, Anthropomorphism, User Retention, Sneaking

## üß™ Running Experiments
### Example Commands
We support 5 main steering methods (DIM, ACE, CAA, PCA, LAT), each with 3 variants (standard, no KL divergence check, conditional/CAST) on 17 datasets based on 3 perspectives specified by 5 concepts (`explicit_bias`, `implicit_bias`, `hallucination_extrinsic`, `hallucination_intrinsic`, `refusal_base`).


```bash
# Full evaluation with entanglement measurement (requires OpenAI key and other keys as needed)
python scripts/run/run_full_pipeline.py -m qwen25-7b -c explicit_bias -M dim

# Different steering variants
python scripts/run/run_full_pipeline.py -m qwen25-7b -c explicit_bias -M dim_nokl      # No KL constraint
python scripts/run/run_full_pipeline.py -m qwen25-7b -c explicit_bias -M dim_conditional # With CAST
```

### Parallel Execution
For comprehensive evaluation across multiple models, concepts, and methods (run on any subset of these):

```bash
python scripts/run/run_parallel_experiments.py \
    --skip-metrics \
    --concepts explicit_bias implicit_bias hallucination_extrinsic refusal_base hallucination_intrinsic \
    --model llama3-1-8b qwen25-7b gemma2-2b \
    --methods dim ace caa pca lat dim_nokl ace_nokl caa_nokl pca_nokl lat_nokl dim_conditional ace_conditional caa_conditional pca_conditional lat_conditional \
    --gpu 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

    --skip-ood \
    --debug \
```

This runs experiments across specified concepts and models in parallel using multiple GPUs. Adjust the concept, model, and method lists as needed, as well as the GPU IDs based on your setup with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES.

### Viewing Results

**Results Location**: All experiments are saved to the `experiments/` directory by default, organized as `experiments/{method}_{concept}_{model}/{timestamp}/`.

For analysis, run the following scripts to aggregate results and create visualizations as in the paper:

1. **Run full pipeline analysis**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run/run_full_pipeline.py --metrics-only --experiments-dir experiments
   ```

   For specific directories:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run/run_concept_metrics.py \
       "experiments/lat_hallucination_intrinsic_llama3-1-8b/" \
       "experiments/baseline_llama3-1-8b/"
   ```
> **Note**: When looking at DarkBench results from experimental directories, the higher the metric the more unsafe the model is. To make it consistent with other datasets, you must do `1 - metric` to get the higher-is-better score.


2. **Generate analysis and plots**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/analysis/analyze_concept_metrics.py \
       --experiments-dir experiments \
       --output-prefix steering_analysis

   python scripts/analysis/generate_all_plots.py experiments/
   ```

## ü§ñ Supported Models

Currently supported models:
- **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct**
- **Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct**
- **Gemma-2-2B-IT**

All models are instruct versions supporting chat templates and are compatible with all steering methods in our framework.

## üìö Datasets

We evaluate on **17 datasets** across 7 perspectives. See our [Hugging Face dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WangResearchLab/SteeringSafety) or [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13450) for detailed descriptions.

### Perspectives
- **Harmfulness**: SALADBench (refusal behavior)
- **Bias**: BBQ (implicit), ToxiGen (explicit)
- **Hallucination**: FaithEval (intrinsic), PreciseWikiQA (extrinsic)
- **Social**: Sycophancy, Anthropomorphism, Brand Bias, User Retention
- **Reasoning**: Expert-level (GPQA), Commonsense (ARC-C)
- **Epistemic**: Factual Misconceptions (TruthfulQA), Sneaking
- **Normative**: Commonsense Morality, Political Views

All of our steering experiments involve harmfulness, bias, and hallucination, but are evaluated on all other perspectives.

### Multiple Choice Evaluation

For multiple-choice datasets, we support both **substring matching** and **likelihood-based** evaluation:

- **Default**: Both methods run simultaneously (`mc_evaluation_method: "both"`)
- **Substring**: Pattern matching in model output (to view entanglement's effects on instruction-following)
- **Likelihood**: Compare log probabilities of answer tokens (to view how behavior shifts internally)

When both methods run, individual results are saved as `"Accuracy (substring)"` and `"Accuracy (likelihood)"` in `metrics.yaml`. The `avg_metric` field uses substring by default (configurable via `preferred_avg_metric: "substring"` or `"likelihood"` in the `inference` section of concept config files):

```yaml
# configs/concepts/my_concept.yaml or configs/secondary_concepts/my_concept.yaml
inference:
  preferred_avg_metric: "likelihood"  # or "substring" (default)
  max_new_tokens: 100
  temperature: 0.0
```

## üîß Modular Framework

We decompose training-free steering methods into three phases:

### 1. Direction Generation
Extract steering vectors from training data:
- **Methods**: `DiffInMeans`, `PCA`, `LAT`
- **Formats**: `SteeringFormat.DEFAULT`, `SteeringFormat.REPE`, `SteeringFormat.CAA`

### 2. Direction Selection
Choose optimal layer and hyperparameters:
- **Grid Search**: Exhaustive search across the desired layers based on val score
- **COSMIC**: Efficient cosine similarity-based selection without full generation

### 3. Direction Application
Apply steering during inference:
- **Activation Addition**: Add scaled direction to activations
- **Directional Ablation**: Remove projection along direction (with optional affine transformation)
- **Locations**: Where in the model to apply steering (same layer as generation, all layers, cumulative across layers, etc.)
- **Positions**: `ALL_TOKENS`, `POST_INSTRUCTION`, `OUTPUT_ONLY`
- **Conditional (CAST)**: Apply only when activation similarity exceeds threshold

## üìã Pre-configured Methods

We implement 5 methods from the literature, each with 3 variants for different effectiveness/entanglement tradeoffs:

All configurations can be found in the `configs/` directory with variants: `{method}.yaml`, `{method}_nokl.yaml`, `{method}_conditional.yaml`

| Method | Components | Paper | Implementation Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|----------|
| **DIM** | DiffInMeans + Directional Ablation | [Arditi et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717) + [COSMIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00085) | Original refusal steering method |
| **ACE** | DiffInMeans + Directional Ablation (affine) | [Marshall et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09003) + [COSMIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00085) | Adds reference projection |
| **CAA** | DiffInMeans + Activation Addition (MC format) | [Panickssery et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681) | Uses multiple-choice format |
| **PCA** | PCA + Activation Addition | [Zou et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405) (RepE) + [CAST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05907) + [AxBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17148) | Principal component analysis |
| **LAT** | LAT + Activation Addition (cumulative) | [Zou et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405) (RepE) + [AxBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17148) | Linear artificial tomography |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Configurations

Importantly, the above 5 methods are not exhaustive. Our modular framework allows easy creation of new methods by combining different components!

For example, to create a new method using LAT with CAA format, COSMIC selection, Directional Ablation application, and Conditional steering (CAST), with different layer and component choices than is used in the paper, simply create a new YAML config:

```yaml
# configs/custom.yaml - LAT + CAA format + COSMIC + Directional Ablation + Conditional

# Override dataset formatting to use CAA templates with LAT:
train_data:
  pos:
    params:
      format: SteeringFormat.CAA  # LAT with CAA format
  neg:
    params:
      format: SteeringFormat.CAA
  neutral: null

# Phase 1: Direction Generation
direction_generation:
  generator:
    class: direction_generation.linear.LAT
    params: {}
  param_grid:
    # Change for every middle layer and attn output component
    layer_pct_start: [0.3]
    layer_pct_end: [0.7]
    layer_step: [1]
    component: ['attn']
    attr: ['output']
    pos: [-1]
    ...

# Phase 2: Direction Selection
direction_selection:
  class: direction_selection.cosmic.COSMIC
  params:
    application_locations: []
    include_generation_loc: true
    generation_pos: POST_INSTRUCTION  # Targeted application
    use_kl_divergence_check: false
    ...

# Phase 3: Direction Application
direction_application:
  class: direction_application.unconditional.DirectionalAblation
  params:
    use_affine: false  # Pure directional ablation
    ...

# Enable conditional steering
conditional:
  enabled: true
  condition_selection:
    class: direction_selection.grid_search.ConditionalGridSearchSelector
    params:
      condition_thresholds: "auto"
      condition_comparators: ["greater"]
      ...
```

We also welcome contributions of new datasets, models, and components to further expand what can be evaluated.

## üî¨ Key Findings

Our evaluation reveals several critical insights about current steering methods:

- **Method effectiveness varies significantly**: DIM and ACE work best for reducing harmfulness and bias, while PCA and LAT show promise for hallucination reduction, but success depends heavily on the specific method-model-perspective combination being used.

- **Entanglement affects different capabilities unevenly**: Social behaviors (like sycophancy and user retention) and normative judgments are most vulnerable to unintended changes during steering, while reasoning capabilities remain relatively stable.

- **Counterintuitive cross-perspective effects emerge**: Jailbreaking doesn't necessarily increase toxicity, hallucination steering causes opposing political shifts in different models, and improving one type of bias can actually degrade another type, showing complex interdependencies between safety perspectives.

- **Conditional steering improves tradeoffs**: Applying steering selectively (conditional steering) achieves effectiveness comparable to the best settings while significantly reducing entanglement for harmfulness and hallucination, though it performs poorly for bias steering.

- **Findings generalize across model scales**: The relative performance rankings of different steering methods and entanglement patterns remain can consistent across models of different sizes, suggesting insights from smaller models can inform steering larger models.

**This represents a major open challenge in AI safety**: developing steering methods that can precisely target specific perspectives without changing performance on other perspectives. We hope this benchmark will accelerate progress toward more controllable and safer steering methods, and in the future, more generally towards safer AI systems.
